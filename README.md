# Flood-Detection-system
IOT  based River Flood Detection system is a system that is developed using the platform of ThingSpeak web server to get stored or retrieved which is of data from the systems. This system relies on  NodeMCU board which act as transmitter and as receiver. The ThingSpeak application acts as server. In order to find the rate of level , ultrasonic sensors were used, they send the values to ThingSpeak application. The web server stores all the data in private channel by default, but there is an option to share data to the general public by using the public channel. Along with NodeMCU consists of Buzzer and LED so that if the threshold is reached the buzzer and LED gets triggered. The results obtained tells that the system can be used at Flood prone areas.
